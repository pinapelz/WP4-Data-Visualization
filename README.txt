Workout Project 4

This program uses the Holodex API to create a visualization for the duration and frequency a Virtual YouTube Streams
(Code documentation for this program can also be found in docs folder. Generated using pdoc)

Holodex is an API used to document and track the activity of Virtual YouTubers/Livestreamers (VTubers)
https://docs.holodex.net/
Unlike YouTube's API. Holodex tracks historical data that can be accessed in a range using one API call. Which is why
I have opted to use Holodex over YouTube's Data API V3

This program pulls the duration of past livestreams a particular VTuber ha done over a certain period of time
and plots this against the delta time since a particular date the user specifies.

An example case:
Qurying the graph for a streamer from 2021-07-01 to 2021-08-01 (YYYY-MM-DD)
1. The program pulls the JSON for each past livestream saving the duration and the date
2. The program will find the stream who's date is closest to 2021-08-01
3. Each stream will be assigned a delta value which is the difference between the date of that particular stream 
   and the date of the stream closest to 2021-08-01 (as obtained in step 2)
4. The program appends this value and the duration of each stream to 2 seperate lists 

This would mean that the distance between points on the x-axis is representitive of how long 2 streams were streamed
apart, and the y-axis represents how long each particular stream was.

Using this metric, its possible to track the metric of how much a streamer has streamed over a given period of time,
how long each stream was, and how much time they were done apart

Some example use cases:
- Track how quickly a VTuber grows accustomed to streaming since their debut stream
- Track length of stream over a period of time and frequency so the reason for why there is a burst of streams can be explained
- Identify gaps and anomalies in streaming patterns (see img1.jpg)
- Identify declining or increasing trend of stream lengths

The labels on the graphs generated by the program also adapt based on the user's inputs and specification

The program takes in the YouTube Channel IDs of various Virtual YouTubers. You can find it on YouTube however since YouTube
has began switching to the @username format in it's URLs. Its much easier to select one from Holodex and copy the ChannelID from there
List of VTubers: https://holodex.net/channel?org=All%20Vtubers
Example: 
https://holodex.net/channel/UCoSrY_IQQVpmIRZ9Xf-y93g 
The ID of the Channel is = UCoSrY_IQQVpmIRZ9Xf-y93g

A valid API key is required, however for this assignment's purposes it has been left in the program

Generated graphs will be named WorkoutProject4-yukais6.jpg
